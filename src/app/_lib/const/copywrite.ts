  "Hello friend, I didn't expect you here. This folder is the repository of my write-ups for CTF challenges that I've completed, aside from the usual suspects like OverTheWire, HackThisWebsite, HackTheBox, and TryHackMe. If you're here, I'm sure you know how to find them";

  "As a full-stack engineer, I thrive on crafting solutions—sometimes for problems that don't even exist yet. My primary expertise is in TypeScript, spanning front-end, back-end, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC), with a particular fondness for deploying infrastructure using AWS CDK. Although TypeScript is my mainstay, I've also worked with other languages like PHP and Python. On a more experimental basis, I can handle C# and Rust. But here’s the key takeaway: to me, a programming language is just a tool. Thanks to my extensive coding experience, I can quickly adapt to new languages and frameworks, getting up to speed in no time.";
